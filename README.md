Notes and Implementation of - Managing real-time risks and returns: The Thomson Reuters NewsScope Event Indices

## Purpose
> Manage event risk, which is posed by unanticipated news that causes major market moves over short time interval.

## The Framework for Real-time News Analytics
> The core of the real-time news analysis engine relied on a scoring method that assesses the relative volume/significance of news from a specific category of news. For instance, we wish to identify period when the volume of news about foreign exchange markets is abnormally high, or when there is a flurry of macroeconomic news announcements.
